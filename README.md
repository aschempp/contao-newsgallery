Contao Extension "newsgallery"
==============================


## Intro ##

This is an extension for the [Contao Open Source CMS][1]. If you are not a software developer, please download or install from the [Contao Extension Repository][2].


## Description ##

Using this extension, you can add an image gallery (identical to the content element) to each news item.

**In Contao 3, this extension is no longer working! Every news item can have unlimited content elements by default, including galleries.**


## Usage ##

After installation, you will see an additional section in every news item, where you can add your images. You must also choose the new news template *news\_full\_gallery* in your news reader frontend module. If you want to show the gallery in other news templates, simply apply the differences.


## Dependencies ##

The Contao Core extension "news" must obviously be enabled. There are no other external dependencies.
